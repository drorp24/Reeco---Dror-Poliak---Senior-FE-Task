### Slider Component:

Create a new component that takes a list of objects and renders each one.
The slider should support "infinite" types of object, below we give example of 2.

### Logic Requirements:

1. **Navigation Arrows**:

   - When the slider is at the beginning or the end, show only the opposite arrow. Otherwise, show both.
   - When clicking on an arrow, the slider should move a 8 pixels.

2. **Render Objects in Multiple Ways**:

   - **Product Card**: A box displaying the product's name, description, and image.
   - **Chips**: A chip contains name of category: Fresh Produce, Pantry, Baking, etc.

3. **Orientation**:
   - Choose either vertical or horizontal layout.

### Design Requirements:

Each component (card/chip) should have a clean and elegant design. You can be creativeâ€”think of it like a store page where all products are displayed on the main page.
A good reference is [Shufersal's online store](https://www.shufersal.co.il/online/).

### Bonus:

1. Responsiveness
2. Support for both vertical and horizontal layouts
3. Arrows: Each click should move one object at a time.

### Guidelines:

Ensure the code is clear and readable.
The task should take approximately 5-6 hours.
Share a public github repository with the source code, github name should be "Reeco - <your name> - Senior FE Task".
